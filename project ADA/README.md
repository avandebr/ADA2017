# A food social media 

# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

Our project will look like a user-based recommandation system for cooking recipes. The goal would be to connect people from all over the world who share the same taste for food and passion for cooking. Since we need users to do this, we will use another dataset than the one provided (which do not include users). We already found some datasets which correspond to what we are looking for but still did not decide which one(s) we will use. 
At the end, this project could allow people from different cultures to share their tastes and also to discover cooking recipes from other regions of the world.

# Research questions
- How can we connect people from different cultures using food ? 
- Use data visualization to find clusters of users which share the same tastes
- Compare user-based and content-based recommandation systems

# Dataset
Since our project will contain different aspects, we could have to work on different datasets depending on the current task we want to achieve. As said previoulsy, we cannot use the provided dataset, but we found some datasets which we could work on.
The first one comes from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/food-ingredient-lists
However, we still have to look for other datasets for some tasks we would like to do but this one should allow us to start.
We expect to get them from cooking recipes websites. 

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- Data exploratory analysis
- Data cleaning
- Build a simple recommandation system 
- Find new ideas to improve it and think about how we can do them 

# Questions for TAs
Our main problem will be to find a good and huge dataset which will provide us all the information we need (for instance rates given by users to some recipes).
